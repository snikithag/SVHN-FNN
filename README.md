### **Requirements**

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the model training with:
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
- Evaluate the model:
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py
  ```

### **Code Structure**

- `train.py`: Script for training the feedforward neural network.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for testing the trained model and generating the confusion matrix.
- `models.py`: Contains the function to build a flexible neural network.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for data loading and preprocessing.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `report.pdf`: Summary of results and findings.

### **Dataset**

- The SVHN dataset is automatically downloaded using `tensorflow_datasets`.
- It is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

### **Hyperparameter Tuning**

- The model supports flexible hyperparameter selection, including:
  - Number of hidden layers: 3, 4, 5
  - Neurons per layer: 32, 64, 128
  - Optimizers: SGD, Momentum, Nesterov, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam
  - Learning rates: 1e-3, 1e-4
  - Batch sizes: 16, 32, 64
  - Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid
  - Weight decay (L2 Regularization): 0, 0.0005, 0.5

### **Plagiarism Policy**

- The code is original, structured, and modularized.
- Proper coding practices have been followed to ensure clarity and reusability.

## **Conclusion**

### **Findings from the Experiments**

1. **Optimal Hyperparameters:**

   - The best performance was achieved with **4 hidden layers**, **128 neurons per layer**, and the **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of **1e-3**.
   - ReLU activation performed significantly better than Sigmoid due to its ability to mitigate vanishing gradients.

2. **Effect of Weight Decay:**

   - **L2 regularization (0.0005)** helped improve generalization by reducing overfitting.
   - Higher weight decay values (0.5) led to underfitting.

3. **Loss Function Comparison:**

   - **Cross-entropy loss** yielded better results compared to **mean squared error loss**, as MSE does not perform well with probabilistic outputs.

### **Recommendations for MNIST**

Based on our findings, if we had to select only three configurations for the MNIST dataset, we would choose:

1. **(Best Performing Model)**

   - **Hidden Layers:** 4
   - **Neurons per Layer:** 128
   - **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate = 1e-3)
   - **Regularization:** L2 (0.0005)
   - **Activation:** ReLU
   - **Expected Accuracy:** \~99%

2. **(Efficient Model for Faster Training)**

   - **Hidden Layers:** 3
   - **Neurons per Layer:** 64
   - **Optimizer:** RMSprop (learning rate = 1e-3)
   - **Regularization:** L2 (0.0005)
   - **Activation:** ReLU
   - **Expected Accuracy:** \~98.5%

3. **(Balanced Model for Generalization)**

   - **Hidden Layers:** 5
   - **Neurons per Layer:** 128, 128, 64, 64, 32
   - **Optimizer:** Momentum-based SGD (learning rate = 1e-3)
   - **Regularization:** L2 (0.0005)
   - **Activation:** ReLU
   - **Expected Accuracy:** \~98%

### **Final Thoughts**

- The knowledge gained from SVHN experiments helped generalize our understanding for MNIST.
- Adam optimizer with **ReLU** activation is generally the best choice for digit classification tasks.
- A moderate level of regularization is necessary to achieve optimal generalization without overfitting.
